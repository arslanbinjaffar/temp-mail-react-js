            <h2>What is Temporary Email?</h2>
            <p>A temporary email, as the name suggests, is an email address created for short-term use. Unlike permanent email services like Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook, temporary emails are designed to last for a limited period, usually ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. Once the time limit is reached, the email address and its associated data are automatically deleted.</p>
            <p>Temporary emails are typically provided by specialized platforms and require no registration. These services allow users to quickly create an email address, receive emails, and even respond to them in some cases.</p>
